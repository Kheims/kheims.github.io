Hey there! I’m a **PhD student** focused on detecting code smells with  **Deep Learning**. When I’m not buried in research papers, you’ll find me experimenting with new ways to **build** and **optimize** all sorts of tech—from orchestrating **data pipelines** to pushing **GPU computing** to its limits. 

## My Work

- **Code Smell Detection**: Using Neural Networks and Graph Neural Networks to spot those  anti-patterns that creep into codebases.  
- **ML Systems**: I geek out over data movement, pipeline architecture, and pretty much anything that makes machine learning more scalable (and fun).
- **Compilers**: I am currently trying to deep dive into compilers intricacies.

## What You’ll Find Here

- **Research Insights**: Thoughts on code quality, ML techniques, and whatever new rabbit hole my PhD journey leads me down.  
- **Project Demos**: Showcasing tools, prototypes, and experiments that (hopefully) make your life a bit easier.  

Thanks for stopping by, and feel free to poke around. If you share my obsession with machine learning, building things, and making code a little less smelly, let’s connect!
